 GETThis API returns all clients/api/location/v2/clients
 This API supports searching by ipv4/ipv6, mac-address and username. Here are some examples to illustrate this behavior.
 
 Search by IPv4/IPv6: api/location/v2/clients?ipAddress=x.x.x.x
 Search by Mac Address: api/location/v2/clients?macAddress=x:x:x:x
 Search by Username: api/location/v2/clients?username=someUsername
 
 This API also supports pagination based on page and page size.
 
 Pagination: api/location/v2/clients?include=metadata&page=x&pageSize=x
 
 As long as there is data you can keep paginating by incrementing the page and the pageSize numbers.pageSize is between 0 and 1000. Default pageSize is 1000.
